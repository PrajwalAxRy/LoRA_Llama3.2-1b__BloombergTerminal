In other cases, however, the two may be different based on the issuer\u2019s \noperations, relationship with parent company, subsidiaries, or legal profile. For example, the issuer\u2019s country of risk can match the country of the issuer\u2019s parent instead \nof its legal domicile when the bond is issued by a subsidiary that is guaranteed by the parent.

        "question": "How does the bond weight contribute to the overall calculation of the index return in Bloomberg's Fixed Income Index Methodology?",
        "answer": "The bond weight represents the percentage contribution of each security to the Returns Universe using market value weights or other index weighting schemes. It is used to calculate the weighted returns for the index."

        "question": "How does one calculate Coupon Return without Reinvestment? What is its formula?",
        "answer": "The Coupon Return without Reinvestment can be calculated by taking the total amount of coupons paid out and dividing it by the initial investment. The formula isn't explicitly shown here but would typically look something like: (\u03a3Coupon Payments) / Initial Investment."

    "context": "Q: Why do hedged indices have currency returns? Isn\u2019t the currency risk hedged \naway? \nA: Hedging can eliminate the majority of currency risk, but there is no way for foreign investors \nto earn exactly the same return as local investors, for two reasons. First, there is no way to know \nat the beginning of a month exactly what the market value of a given investment will be at the \nend of the month. The amount by which the size of the hedge is different from the ultimate end-\nof-month market value (either too big or too small) results in a (usually small) exposure to \nchanges in FX rates. Second, even if we assume that the hedge is set up in exactly the right size, \nthere is a carry component (which can be either positive or negative) that corresponds to the \ndifference between spot and forward rates. \nThe carry is proportional to the difference between the short-term deposit rates in the two"

    "context": "and that the last business day of this month is the 28th. We would need to offset the starting \none-month forward with an 18-day forward (i.e., 28 \u2013 10 = 18 days). In theory, we could obtain an \n18-day rate directly for the forward market; in practice, only certain periods (tenors) are quoted, \nand we need to interpolate to arrive at a rate for the desired period. \nFor the sake of simplicity, we use a linear interpolation based on the current one-month forward \nand spot rates. In our example, we calculate the 18-day forward rate as the current spot rate plus \nthe premium or discount between spot and 1m forward prorated for 18 days. \nFormulae for Monthly Calculation: Single Currency Index \n\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45= \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f= \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f,\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f,\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\n\u22121 \n\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45= \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36= \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f,\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\n\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f,\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\n\u22121 \n\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39 \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45= \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39= \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f,\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60,1\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\n\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f,\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\n\u22121 \n\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45 \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48\u210e\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43= (1 + \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f) \u00d7 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36"
