The equations mentioned in Hull and White (2000) and Jarrow and Turnbull (1995) provide a framework for modeling credit risk.

Not all bonds have a paydown return calculated for them. Typically, this calculation applies to bonds with a discount or premium to par value. However, other bond types may not necessarily involve a paydown return, such as zero-coupon bonds, which do not make periodic interest payments and are sold at a significant discount to their face value.
