  },
  {
    "question": "What are some key differences in unhedged currency returns among bonds denominated in the same currency?",
    "answer": "All bonds in a given currency will be subject to the same change in FX rates. However, because BISL expresses currency returns using an additive convention, the reported currency return also depends on the local return of a bond."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do hedged indices address currency risk, and what are some limitations of hedging?",
    "answer": "Hedging can eliminate the majority of currency risk. However, there is no way for foreign investors to earn exactly the same return as local investors due to market value uncertainty at the beginning of a month."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you provide an example of how unhedged currency returns differ among bonds in the same currency?",
    "answer": "Each bond's return depends on its local return, which can vary. For instance, two bonds with the same exchange rate change will have different overall returns due to their differing local performance."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the role of FX Appreciation in determining unhedged currency returns for Bloomberg Indices?",

  },
  {
    "question": "Are there any scenarios where hedging would not fully eliminate currency risk for investors?",
    "answer": "Yes, even with hedging, the exact market value of an investment at the beginning of the month cannot be predicted. This leads to some residual currency risk that foreign investors still face."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary reason hedged indices still have currency returns despite hedging currency risk?",
    "answer": "Hedging can eliminate most of the currency risk, but there's no way for foreign investors to earn exactly the same return as local investors due to exchange rate differences."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you explain why it's challenging to fully eliminate currency risk through hedging?",
    "answer": "There are two reasons: uncertainty in market value at the end of a month and differences between spot and forward rates that result in a carry component."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the size difference between the hedge and the actual market value affect currency returns for hedged indices?",
    "answer": "Even with a well-sized hedge, the amount by which it differs from the ultimate end-of-month market value can expose investors to changes in FX rates."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the carry component that contributes to currency returns in hedged indices?",
    "answer": "The carry component corresponds to the difference between spot and forward rates and is proportional to the short-term deposit rates in the two currencies involved."

  },
  {
    "question": "How does Bloomberg Indices determine the size of a hedge?",
    "answer": "The size of the hedge is not assumed to be the ending market value, which cannot be known at the start of the month. It is also not assumed to be the beginning market value, since this would result in a systematic bias toward under-hedging."
  },
  {
    "question": "What method does BISL use to project end-of-month market value for securities other than mortgages?",
    "answer": "BISL uses a projection of end-of-month market value. For securities other than mortgages, this projection is based on the combination of beginning-of-month market value and yield."
  },
  {
    "question": "What assumption does Bloomberg Indices make when unwinding FX forward contracts intra-month?",
    "answer": "To calculate intra-month hedged returns, BISL assumes that the FX forward contract is unwound using a prorated forward rate. A 30-day contract is assumed for every month regardless of the actual number of days in a month."
  },
  {
    "question": "What effect would assuming beginning-of-month market value as the hedge size have on hedging?",
    "answer": "Assuming beginning-of-month market value as the hedge size would result in a systematic bias toward under-hedging."
