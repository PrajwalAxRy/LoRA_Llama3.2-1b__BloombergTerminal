Provide a brief explanation for your reasoning. The answer should be completely self-contained and based on general knowledge of the financial industry and the Bloomberg Terminal.

- **Accuracy Score**:
  - **0**: The question is not a real question or is nonsensical.
  - **1-3**: The answer is completely incorrect or does not adequately answer the question.
  - **4-6**: The answer is partially correct but has significant errors or omissions.
  - **7-9**: The answer is mostly accurate but could be more precise or detailed.
  - **10**: The answer is perfectly accurate, specific, and correct.

- **Style Score**:
  - **1-3**: The question or answer is harmful, unhelpful, dishonest, or contains gibberish.
  - **4-6**: The style is poor, unprofessional, or hard to understand.
  - **7-9**: The style is good, clear, and helpful.
  - **10**: The style is excellent, professional, and perfectly clear.

- **Record to Score**:
  - **Question**: {record['question']}
  - **Answer**: {record['answer']}

- **Return your response in this exact JSON format**:
